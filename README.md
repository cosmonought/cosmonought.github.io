## You Dream of a Beautiful Future

This is not an argument, a discourse, a disquisition, or advice; collected here are various efforts to give voice to the process of reading, to 'take thinking for a walk', to charter coordinates for future study by regarding developing socio-political technologies as crucial interlocutors in philosophical debates—without guarantee of those efforts' yield or termination, cohesion or completeness.

_Caveat discipulus_, therefore: because the effort is to be rigorous without a guarantee of merchandisability, the appearance of solidity or consistency could well be regarded as a feint, a strategic or aesthetic maneuver to spotlight certain kinds of discord and disorder (alternative slips and faints) in the still-inchoate-but-emerging world(s) of Web 3.0, rather than inviolate principles of engagement.

Likewise, in the spirit of crypto's rejection of top-down organizational economies, reflections here are primarily bottom-up 'local skirmishes' occasioned by particular texts or events, i.e., interventions in site- (or, sometimes, chain-)specific contexts, with the thoroughly _casuistic_ insistence that it is only in the varied melée of immovable concrete instances that the supple mobility of abstract concepts can be tested for their ordnance of truth. (Note: truth here is allied to plasticity in its broad semantic range, as moldable vs rigid, as explosive dissensus rather than congealing homogeneity, as unstable recycles of credit and commodity.) ((Note on  note: this is not to say truth is socially constructed, as the emphasis on _dissensus_ may suggest.))

So, why is blockchain the occasion for these reflections? or, rather, in what 'local skirmish' does blockchain technology intervene that could be of interest to an allegedly 'post-'Lacanian philosopher of human nature? What can one trained on the Freudian concepts of sex, subjectivity, and the unconscious have to venture upon the heady combinations of social theories, monetary principles, political theologies, and technological change that are driving the nascent development of allegedly sovereign forms of digital life?
