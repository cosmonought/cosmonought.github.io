This is not an argument, a discourse, a disquisition, or advice; collected here are various efforts to give voice to the process of reading, to 'take thinking for a walk', to charter coordinates for future study in response to developing socio-political technologies as crucial philosophical interlocutors——without guarantee of those efforts' yield or termination, cohesion or completeness.

_Caveat discipulus_, therefore: because the effort is to be rigorous without a guarantee of merchandisability, the appearance of solidity or consistency could well be regarded as a feint, a strategic or aesthetic maneuver to spotlight other kinds of discord and disorder, slips and faints, in the inchoate-but-emerging world(s) of Web 3.0. 

In the spirit of declining top-down organizations of both thinking and society, reflections here are primarily bottom-up 'local skirmishes' occasioned by particular events, i.e., interventions in site- (or, if you like, chain-)specific contexts, with the acute insistence that it is only in the varied melée of immovable concrete instances that abstract concepts can be truly tested and grasped.

So, why is blockchain the occasion for these reflections? or, rather, in what 'local skirmish' does blockchain technology intervene that could be of interest to an allegedly 'post-'Lacanian philosopher of human nature?
